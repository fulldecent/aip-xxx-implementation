# AIP-XXX Favorite Number â€” Example Implementation

This project implements AIP-XXX, the Favorite Number Standard using all best practices.

 - `aipXXXGetFavoriteNumber()`
 - `aipXXXSetFavoriteNumber()`

This project also extends by adding its own features.

 - `setFavoriteNumberOnBackwardsDay()`
 - `getOwner()`
 - `setOwner()`

## Prerequisites

1. Supported operating systems are macOS, Linux and Windows
2. Install Java (version 11 or later) and Apache Maven
   - On macOS
     1. [Do not use](https://stackoverflow.com/a/28635465/300224) the official installer from Oracle, that approach is painful, nobody uses it
     2. [Install Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
     3. `brew cask install java`
     4. `brew install maven`

## Building and testing

Prepare your Maven project build state

```sh
./mvnw initialize
```

Build and test

```sh
./mvnw clean install verify
```

A build which passes all tests will be indicated by:

> [INFO] BUILD SUCCESS

at the bottom of your build.

After you have made any changes, run the build and test command above.
